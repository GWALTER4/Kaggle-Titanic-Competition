# Kaggle Titanic Competition
 
The code used to generate predictions for my submission to Kaggle's Titanic competition. The competition involved predicting the survival of Titanic passengers based on a dataset of 1309 passengers. 

My submission received a reasonably good score of 0.80382. The code was written using the sci-kit learn, pandas, numpy, seaborn, and matplotlib python libraries. The predictions for my submission were generated using an ensemble of three classifiers: K-nearest neighbor, logistic regression, and a random forest.
